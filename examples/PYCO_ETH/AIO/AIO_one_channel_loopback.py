AIO - AIO_one_channel_loopback.py

This example demonstrates the process of AIO loopback with specific channels.
It involves using AO pins to send signals and AI pins to receive signals on a single device, commonly referred to as "loopback".
The AI and AO pins are connected using a wire.
The AO range is -10 to 10 V.

First, it reads AI data and displays its corresponding values.
Following that, it writes digital signals to the AO pins and reads AI on demand data once again.

## WPC
import pywpc

## Write AO vaule -10(V) in channel 0
ch0 = 0
voltage0 = -10
status = pywpc.AO_writeOneChannel(ch0, voltage0)
print("AO_writeOneChannel status: ", status)

## Read data acquisition
ai_data = pywpc.AI_readOnDemand()
print(ai_data)
