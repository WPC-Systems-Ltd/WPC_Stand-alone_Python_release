## WPC
import pywpc

## Parameters setting
pin_state = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

## Write port to high or low
status = pywpc.DO_writeAllChannels(pin_state)
print("DO_writeAllChannels status: ", status)

## Read DI port state
state_list = pywpc.DI_readAllChannels()
print("DI_readAllChannels: ", state_list)
